# ü§ñ Terragon Autonomous SDLC Engine

**Perpetual Value Discovery & Execution System**

This directory contains the Terragon Autonomous SDLC Engine that continuously discovers, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value software development lifecycle improvements for your repository.

## üéØ System Overview

The autonomous engine operates on multiple time scales to ensure continuous value delivery:

- **Immediate**: Value discovery after each PR merge
- **Hourly**: Security vulnerability scanning  
- **Daily**: Comprehensive analysis + automatic execution
- **Weekly**: Deep technical debt review + bulk improvements
- **Monthly**: Strategic review + scoring model recalibration

## üìÅ System Components

### Core Engine Files
- **`config.yaml`** - Configuration for scoring weights, thresholds, and discovery sources
- **`value-metrics.json`** - Real-time metrics tracking execution history and learning
- **`autonomous-discovery.py`** - Value discovery engine with WSJF+ICE+TechDebt scoring
- **`value-executor.py`** - Autonomous execution engine with safety checks
- **`scheduler.py`** - Continuous scheduling and execution management

### Configuration Overview

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    advanced:
      wsjf: 0.5        # Weighted Shortest Job First prioritization
      ice: 0.1         # Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease scoring  
      technicalDebt: 0.3  # Technical debt reduction priority
      security: 0.1    # Security vulnerability boost
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Manual Value Discovery
```bash
# Discover and prioritize improvement opportunities
python .terragon/autonomous-discovery.py

# Check the generated BACKLOG.md for prioritized items
cat BACKLOG.md
```

### 2. Execute Next Best Value Item
```bash
# Execute the highest-priority item automatically
python .terragon/value-executor.py

# This will:
# - Select the top-scored item from backlog
# - Execute the improvement automatically  
# - Run tests and quality checks
# - Create a PR if successful
# - Update value metrics
```

### 3. Run Scheduled Cycles
```bash
# Run a single daily cycle (discovery + execution)
python .terragon/scheduler.py --mode single --cycle daily

# Run continuous autonomous scheduler (production)
python .terragon/scheduler.py --mode scheduler
```

## üéØ Scoring Algorithm

The system uses a hybrid **WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt** scoring model:

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
Cost of Delay = (User Value √ó 0.4) + (Time Criticality √ó 0.3) + 
                (Risk Reduction √ó 0.2) + (Opportunity √ó 0.1)
WSJF Score = Cost of Delay / Job Size
```

### ICE (Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease)
```
ICE Score = Impact(1-10) √ó Confidence(1-10) √ó Ease(1-10)
```

### Technical Debt Factor
```
Debt Score = Impact √ó Risk √ó Hotspot Multiplier
```

### Composite Score
```
Final Score = (WSJF √ó 0.5) + (ICE √ó 0.1) + (Debt √ó 0.3) + (Security Boost √ó 0.1)
```

## üîç Discovery Sources

The system continuously monitors multiple sources:

### Static Analysis
- **Ruff**: Python code quality and style issues
- **MyPy**: Type checking and safety improvements
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability detection
- **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity hotspots

### Git History Analysis  
- **TODO/FIXME/HACK Comments**: Technical debt markers
- **Commit Pattern Analysis**: Quick fixes and temporary solutions
- **File Churn vs Complexity**: Maintenance burden identification

### Security Scanning
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: CVE and security advisory monitoring
- **Code Security Issues**: Potential security anti-patterns
- **Container Security**: Docker image vulnerability scanning

### Performance Analysis
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Async/await pattern analysis  
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU optimization opportunities
- **Load Testing Results**: Performance regression identification

## üìä Value Metrics Tracking

### Execution History
Every autonomous execution is tracked with:
- Estimated vs actual effort
- Predicted vs realized impact
- Success/failure outcomes
- Learning adjustments

### Business Value Quantification
- **Time Saved**: Developer hours saved through automation
- **Risk Reduction**: Security vulnerabilities eliminated
- **Technical Debt**: Maintenance burden reduced
- **Performance Gains**: Optimization improvements delivered

### Learning & Adaptation
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Continuous model refinement
- **Value Prediction**: Impact assessment improvement
- **False Positive Rate**: Discovery quality enhancement
- **Execution Success Rate**: Automation reliability tracking

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Quality Controls

### Pre-Execution Validation
- Minimum composite score threshold (configurable)
- Maximum risk tolerance (configurable)  
- Dependency conflict detection
- Resource availability checks

### During Execution
- Real-time test execution monitoring
- Code coverage maintenance verification
- Security scan validation
- Performance regression detection

### Post-Execution Verification
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- Code quality metrics validation
- Security posture maintenance
- Rollback triggers on failure

### Automatic Rollback Conditions
- Test failures
- Code coverage drops below threshold
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- Build failures

## üîÑ Continuous Learning

### Model Adaptation
The system continuously learns from execution outcomes:

1. **Effort Estimation**: Compares predicted vs actual execution time
2. **Impact Assessment**: Measures delivered value vs predictions
3. **Risk Evaluation**: Tracks success rates by risk level
4. **Priority Calibration**: Adjusts scoring weights based on results

### Feedback Loop Integration
- **PR Review Comments**: Incorporate reviewer feedback into scoring
- **User Satisfaction**: Track adoption and approval rates
- **Business Metrics**: Align with development velocity and quality goals
- **Technical Metrics**: Monitor code health improvements over time

## üìà Advanced Configuration
