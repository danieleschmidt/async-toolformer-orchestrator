## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues privately:

1. **Email**: async-tools@yourdomain.com
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - async-toolformer-orchestrator`
3. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab

### 📋 What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Authentication, authorization, injection, etc.
- **Impact Assessment**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are vulnerable
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear reproduction steps
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

### 🕐 Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with fix timeline
- **30 days**: Security patch release (for high/critical issues)

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our project:

- **Security Hall of Fame**: Listed in our security acknowledgments
- **CVE Attribution**: Credited in CVE reports where applicable
- **Bug Bounty**: Contact us for details about our recognition program

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using async-toolformer-orchestrator:

1. **API Key Security**:
   ```python
   # ❌ Don't hardcode API keys
   client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key="sk-...")
   
   # ✅ Use environment variables
   client = AsyncOpenAI()  # Reads OPENAI_API_KEY from env
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   ```python
   # ✅ Always configure rate limits
   config = RateLimitConfig(
       global_max=100,
       service_limits={"openai": {"calls": 50, "tokens": 150000}}
   )
   ```

3. **Input Validation**:
   ```python
   # ✅ Validate tool inputs
   @Tool(description="Safe file reader")
   async def read_file(filepath: str) -> str:
       # Validate file path to prevent directory traversal
       if ".." in filepath or filepath.startswith("/"):
           raise ValueError("Invalid file path")
       # Implementation here
   ```

4. **Network Security**:
   - Use HTTPS for all external API calls
   - Implement proper TLS verification
   - Configure firewall rules for production deployments

### For Contributors

When contributing code:

1. **Dependency Security**:
   - Run `bandit` security scanning before committing
   - Keep dependencies updated with security patches
   - Use `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

2. **Code Review**:
   - All security-related changes require maintainer review
   - Use secure coding practices for async operations
   - Validate all external inputs

3. **Testing**:
   - Include security test cases for new features
   - Test rate limiting and error handling paths
   - Verify input sanitization works correctly

## Known Security Considerations

### Async Operations

- **Resource Exhaustion**: Unlimited parallel tool execution can exhaust system resources
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access to shared state requires proper synchronization
- **Timeout Handling**: Improper timeout handling can lead to resource leaks

### External API Integration

- **API Key Exposure**: Keys may be logged or exposed in error messages
- **Data Leakage**: Tool results may contain sensitive information
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Unverified HTTPS connections are vulnerable

### Rate Limiting

- **Bypass Attempts**: Distributed rate limiting may have edge cases
- **DoS Protection**: Rate limiters must handle malicious traffic patterns

## Security Testing

We maintain comprehensive security testing:

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checking
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent key commits

### Manual Security Review

- **Architecture Review**: Regular security architecture assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing of critical paths
- **Code Audits**: Security-focused code reviews for major releases

## Compliance

### Data Privacy

- **No Data Storage**: We don't store user data or API responses by default
- **Memory Management**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory promptly
- **Logging Safety**: No sensitive information is logged

### Industry Standards

- **OWASP Guidelines**: Following OWASP API security practices
- **Secure Development**: Implementing secure SDLC practices
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Following responsible disclosure standards

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Stay informed about security updates:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Official vulnerability announcements
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes are highlighted in releases
- **Mailing List**: Security announcements mailing list (coming soon)

### Update Policy

- **Critical Security Issues**: Immediate patch releases
- **High Priority Issues**: Patches within 7 days
- **Medium/Low Issues**: Included in next regular release
