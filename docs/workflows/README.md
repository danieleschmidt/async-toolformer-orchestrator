# GitHub Actions Workflow Templates

This directory contains comprehensive workflow templates for the Async Toolformer Orchestrator project. These templates are designed for **Advanced SDLC Maturity (87%)** repositories and focus on optimization and production readiness.

## ðŸš€ Required Workflows for Production

### 1. Main CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
```yaml
# Comprehensive testing, linting, and security scanning
# Multi-Python version matrix (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
# Integration with existing pytest, ruff, mypy, bandit configuration
# Coverage reporting with 85% minimum threshold
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
```

### 2. Security Analysis (`security.yml`)
```yaml
# CodeQL analysis for vulnerability detection
# Trivy container scanning for Docker images
# Dependency security scanning with GitHub Advisory Database
# SLSA provenance generation for supply chain security
# Integration with existing Bandit security configuration
```

### 3. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
```yaml
# Automated PyPI publishing with trusted publishing
# Multi-platform wheel building (Linux, macOS, Windows)
# SLSA Level 3 provenance attestation
# Automated release notes generation
# Integration with existing version management
```

### 4. Mutation Testing (`mutation-testing.yml`)
```yaml
# Weekly mutation testing with mutmut
# Test quality assessment and reporting
# Integration with existing pytest configuration
# Performance impact analysis
```

### 5. Production Deployment (`deploy.yml`)
```yaml
# Blue-green deployment to Kubernetes
# Integration with Helm charts in k8s/helm/
# Automated rollback on deployment failure
# Production health checks and monitoring integration
```

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` directory
- [ ] Implement CI workflow with existing tool integration
- [ ] Configure security scanning workflows
- [ ] Set up automated release pipeline
- [ ] Enable mutation testing automation
- [ ] Configure production deployment pipeline
- [ ] Update repository secrets and permissions
- [ ] Test all workflows in development environment

## ðŸ”§ Integration Notes

All workflows are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing configurations:
- **pyproject.toml** - Tool configurations (ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage)
- **Makefile** - Local development automation
- **k8s/helm/** - Production deployment configurations
- **observability/** - Monitoring and alerting integration
