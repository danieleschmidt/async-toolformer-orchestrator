# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

This repository contains comprehensive CI/CD workflow templates in `docs/workflows/`. To activate them:

### 1. Create Workflows Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 2. Deploy Core Workflows
```bash
# Copy and activate the workflow templates
cp docs/workflows/ci-template.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
cp docs/workflows/security-template.yml .github/workflows/security.yml  
cp docs/workflows/deployment-template.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

### 3. Configure Secrets (Required)
Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

**CI/CD Secrets:**
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage reporting
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - For dependency vulnerability scanning

**Deployment Secrets:**
- `KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING` - Base64 encoded kubeconfig for staging
- `KUBE_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` - Base64 encoded kubeconfig for production
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - Container registry authentication

### 4. Additional Configuration Files Needed

Create `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`:
```yaml
name: "Advanced CodeQL Config"
queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality
  - uses: security-extended
paths-ignore:
  - "tests/"
  - "docs/"
  - "benchmarks/"
```

### 5. Verify Integration

After setup, verify the integration works:
```bash
# Test locally first
make check  # Runs lint, typecheck, unit tests
make test-coverage  # Runs full test suite with coverage
make security  # Runs security checks
```

### 6. Workflow Triggers

The workflows will trigger on:
- **CI**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main
- **Security**: Push to main, PRs to main, weekly schedule
- **Deploy**: Releases and manual triggers

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Performance Optimization
- Workflows use matrix builds for Python 3.10-3.12
- Parallel execution of independent checks
- Cached dependencies for faster builds

### Security Features
- CodeQL analysis for code security
- Snyk for dependency vulnerabilities  
- Trivy for container scanning
- SARIF upload for GitHub Security tab

### Deployment Strategy
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime
- Helm chart integration with existing k8s/ configs
- Environment-specific configurations

## Monitoring and Alerts

The workflows integrate with:
- **Codecov** for coverage tracking
- **GitHub Security** tab for vulnerability management
- **Slack/Teams** notifications (configure webhook URLs)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Missing secrets**: Workflows will fail with clear error messages
- **Makefile integration**: Ensure all `make` targets exist and work locally
- **Container builds**: Dockerfile must be present in repository root

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the workflows using the commands above
2. Configure required secrets in GitHub repository settings
3. Create a test PR to verify CI pipeline works
4. Monitor first deployment to staging environment
5. Review security scan results and address any findings

This setup provides enterprise-grade CI/CD for your advanced Python project with comprehensive testing, security scanning, and deployment automation.
