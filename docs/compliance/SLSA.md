# SLSA Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines our Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) compliance implementation for the async-toolformer-orchestrator project.

## SLSA Level 3 Compliance

### Build Requirements Met

#### Source Requirements
- ✅ **Version Controlled**: All source code is stored in Git with cryptographic integrity
- ✅ **Two-person Review**: All changes require PR approval from code owners
- ✅ **Retained Indefinitely**: Git history preserves all changes

#### Build Requirements
- ✅ **Scripted Build**: Automated build process using GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Build Service**: Builds run on GitHub-hosted runners
- ✅ **Ephemeral Environment**: Fresh environment for each build
- ✅ **Isolated**: Build environment is isolated from external influence

#### Provenance Requirements
- ✅ **Available**: Build provenance generated for all releases
- ✅ **Authenticated**: Provenance signed with GitHub OIDC tokens
- ✅ **Service Generated**: Provenance generated by trusted build service
- ✅ **Non-falsifiable**: Cryptographically signed provenance

#### Common Requirements
- ✅ **Security**: Build process protected against tampering
- ✅ **Access**: Source and build logs are available for auditing
- ❌ **Superusers**: Working toward eliminating admin access during builds

## Implementation Details

### Provenance Generation
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/release.yml
- name: Generate SLSA Provenance
  uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v1.9.0
  with:
    base64-subjects: ${{ steps.hash.outputs.hashes }}
    upload-assets: true
```

### Build Attestation
All builds include:
- Source commit SHA and branch
- Build parameters and environment
- Dependency tree and versions
- Build output hashes

### Verification Process
Users can verify package integrity:
```bash
# Download provenance
gh release download v1.0.0 --pattern "*.slsa-provenance"

# Verify with slsa-verifier
slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
  --provenance-path async-toolformer-orchestrator-1.0.0.tar.gz.slsa-provenance \
  --source-uri github.com/yourusername/async-toolformer-orchestrator \
  async-toolformer-orchestrator-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Security Measures

### Dependency Management
- All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- Regular security audits with `pip-audit`
- Automated dependency updates with security patches
- SBOM generation for all releases

### Build Environment Security
- Minimal Ubuntu images for builds
- No persistent state between builds
- Network restrictions during build
- Secrets access limited by principle of least privilege

### Signing and Verification
- All releases signed with GitHub OIDC tokens
- Package signatures verifiable through sigstore
- Container images signed with cosign
- Git commits signed with GPG

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Daily SLSA compliance verification
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Build reproducibility testing
- Provenance validation

### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly security architecture review
- Annual third-party security audit
- Continuous threat model updates
- Regular compliance gap analysis

## Reporting and Incident Response

### Security Reporting
- Dedicated security email: security@async-toolformer.com
- 90-day coordinated disclosure policy
- Public security advisories for confirmed issues
- Integration with GitHub Security Advisories

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and user reports
2. **Analysis**: Security team assessment within 24 hours
3. **Containment**: Immediate measures to limit impact  
4. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerability from all versions
5. **Recovery**: Coordinated patch release and notification
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Roadmap to SLSA Level 4

### Outstanding Requirements
- [ ] Two-person approval for all releases
- [ ] Hermetic build environment (no network access)
- [ ] Reproducible builds across different environments
- [ ] Advanced build isolation with hardware security

### Timeline
- **Q2 2025**: Implement hermetic builds
- **Q3 2025**: Enable reproducible builds
- **Q4 2025**: Complete SLSA Level 4 certification
