    result = benchmark(
        orchestrator.execute,
        "Execute 10 parallel searches for Python async patterns"
    )
    
    # Performance assertions
    assert result.execution_time_ms < 1000

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Latency**: P50, P95, P99 response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second sustained
- **Efficiency**: Parallel execution efficiency ratio
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network utilization
- **Error Rates**: Timeout, cancellation, failure rates

### Real-time Monitoring Queries
```promql
# Average response time
rate(async_orchestrator_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / 
rate(async_orchestrator_duration_seconds_count[5m])

# Parallel efficiency
async_orchestrator_parallel_efficiency{quantile="0.95"}

# Memory usage growth
increase(process_resident_memory_bytes[1h])

# Error rate
rate(async_orchestrator_errors_total[5m]) / 
rate(async_orchestrator_requests_total[5m])
```
