# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the async-toolformer-orchestrator service to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) & Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Service Component | RTO | RPO | Priority |
|------------------|-----|-----|----------|
| Core API Service | 15 minutes | 5 minutes | Critical |
| Rate Limiting | 10 minutes | 1 minute | Critical |
| Monitoring/Metrics | 30 minutes | 15 minutes | High |
| Documentation Site | 2 hours | 1 hour | Medium |

## Disaster Scenarios

### 1. Complete AWS Region Failure

**Impact**: Total service unavailability in primary region

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:
   - Automated failover to secondary region (us-west-2)
   - DNS switching via Route 53 health checks
   - Validate secondary region health

2. **Short-term (5-30 minutes)**:
   - Scale up secondary region infrastructure
   - Restore Redis cache from backup
   - Verify all external integrations

3. **Long-term (30+ minutes)**:
   - Monitor performance and scaling
   - Prepare primary region recovery
   - Communication to stakeholders

**Automation**: 
```bash
# Automated failover script
./scripts/disaster-recovery/failover-region.sh --from us-east-1 --to us-west-2
```

### 2. Database/Redis Failure

**Impact**: Rate limiting and caching unavailable

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate**:
   - Switch to degraded mode (in-memory rate limiting)
   - Alert operations team
   - Begin database restoration

2. **Database Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Restore from latest backup
   aws rds restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot \
     --db-cluster-identifier async-toolformer-prod-restored \
     --snapshot-identifier async-toolformer-prod-latest
   ```

3. **Redis Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Restore Redis from S3 backup
   ./scripts/redis/restore-from-backup.sh latest
   ```

### 3. Code Repository Compromise

**Impact**: Development and deployment pipeline affected

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Immediate**:
   - Isolate compromised systems
   - Disable automated deployments
   - Switch to emergency deployment process

2. **Investigation**:
   - Forensic analysis of compromise scope
   - Review all recent commits and releases
   - Validate integrity of production systems

3. **Recovery**:
   - Restore repository from verified backup
   - Re-validate all recent releases
   - Reset all secrets and API keys

### 4. Third-party API Provider Outage

**Impact**: Reduced functionality for affected API calls

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **Automatic**:
   - Circuit breaker activation
   - Fallback to alternative providers
   - User notification of degraded service

2. **Manual**:
   - Monitor provider status pages
   - Adjust rate limits for available providers
   - Scale up alternative service capacity

## Backup Strategy

### Code and Configuration
- **Git repositories**: Mirrored to 3 locations (GitHub, GitLab, internal)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Daily backups to S3 with versioning
- **Secrets**: Encrypted backups in separate security boundary

### Data Backups
```bash
# Daily automated backups
0 2 * * * /opt/async-toolformer/scripts/backup/daily-backup.sh

# Weekly full system backup
0 1 * * 0 /opt/async-toolformer/scripts/backup/weekly-backup.sh
```

### Backup Validation
- **Daily**: Automated backup integrity checks
- **Weekly**: Full restore test in staging environment
- **Monthly**: Cross-region backup verification

## Communication Plan

### Internal Escalation
1. **Level 1**: On-call engineer (immediate)
2. **Level 2**: Engineering manager (within 15 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: CTO and executive team (within 30 minutes)

### External Communication
- **Status Page**: Automated updates at status.async-toolformer.com
- **Customer Notifications**: Email alerts for enterprise customers
- **Social Media**: Twitter updates for public incidents

## Recovery Procedures

### Infrastructure Recovery

#### Kubernetes Cluster
```bash
# Deploy to backup cluster
kubectl config use-context prod-backup
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n async-toolformer
kubectl logs -f deployment/orchestrator
```

#### Load Balancer Recovery
```bash
# Switch traffic to backup region
aws elbv2 modify-target-group \
  --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/async-toolformer-backup/1234567890123456 \
  --targets Id=i-1234567890abcdef0,Port=8080
```

### Application Recovery

#### Service Restart
```bash
# Graceful restart with rolling deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/orchestrator -n async-toolformer

# Verify health
kubectl get pods -n async-toolformer -w
```

#### Cache Warm-up
```bash
# Pre-load frequently used data
./scripts/cache/warm-up.sh --environment production
```
