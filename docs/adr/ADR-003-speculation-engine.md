# ADR-003: Speculation Engine Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
LLM tool calling often involves predictable patterns where certain tools are highly likely to be called based on the prompt. Waiting for the LLM to confirm tool calls before starting execution introduces unnecessary latency. We need a mechanism to speculatively execute likely tool calls while the LLM is still processing.

## Decision
We will implement a speculation engine that:
1. Uses a fast, lightweight model to predict likely tool calls
2. Starts executing these tools speculatively before LLM confirmation
3. Commits successful speculations when they match actual tool calls
4. Cancels incorrect speculations to free resources
5. Maintains a cache of speculation patterns for common prompts

### Architecture

### Key Components

#### SpeculativeEngine
- Manages speculation lifecycle
- Tracks active speculations and their confidence scores
- Handles commitment and cancellation of speculations
- Maintains metrics for hit rate and performance gains

#### SpeculationContext
- Encapsulates prompt and history for predictions
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Maximum speculation limits

#### SpeculationResult
- Tracks individual speculation status
- Records execution time saved
- Maintains commitment/cancellation state

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reduced Latency**: 30-50% reduction in end-to-end execution time for predictable patterns
- **Better Resource Utilization**: CPU/network resources used during LLM processing time
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster response times for common queries
- **Learning Capability**: Cache improves prediction accuracy over time

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: Additional component to maintain and debug
- **Resource Overhead**: Wasted computation on incorrect speculations
- **Cost Implications**: Additional API calls to fast model
- **Cache Management**: Need to manage speculation cache lifecycle

### Neutral
- **Configuration Required**: Needs tuning of confidence thresholds
- **Model Selection**: Choice of speculation model affects accuracy/speed tradeoff
- **Metrics Tracking**: Additional metrics to monitor speculation effectiveness

## Implementation Details

### Confidence Scoring
```python
confidence = base_confidence * pattern_match_score * historical_success_rate
```

### Speculation Strategies
1. **Keyword Matching**: Simple pattern matching for common tool patterns
2. **Historical Patterns**: Learn from successful past speculations
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Use prompt embedding similarity
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine multiple strategies with weighted scoring

### Resource Management
- Maximum concurrent speculations limited to prevent resource exhaustion
- Automatic cancellation of slow speculations when better results arrive
- Memory-aware speculation limits based on system resources

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No Speculation
Keep simple sequential execution.
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, no wasted computation
- **Cons**: Higher latency, underutilized resources

### Alternative 2: Rule-Based Speculation
Use hard-coded rules for speculation.
- **Pros**: Predictable behavior, no model costs
- **Cons**: Limited coverage, maintenance burden

### Alternative 3: Client-Side Hints
Let clients provide speculation hints.
- **Pros**: High accuracy, client control
- **Cons**: API complexity, client implementation burden
