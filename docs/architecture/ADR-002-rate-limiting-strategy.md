# ADR-002: Rate Limiting Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The orchestrator must handle rate limits for multiple APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom services) simultaneously while maintaining high throughput. Different services have varying rate limit structures (requests/minute, tokens/minute, concurrent connections).

## Decision
Implement a multi-tier rate limiting system:

### Rate Limiting Tiers
1. **Global Rate Limiter**: Overall system throughput control
2. **Service Rate Limiters**: Per-API provider limits
3. **Tool Rate Limiters**: Per-tool-type limits
4. **User Rate Limiters**: Per-user quota management

### Rate Limiting Algorithms
- **Token Bucket**: For burst capacity handling
- **Sliding Window**: For sustained rate enforcement
- **Adaptive Limiting**: Dynamic adjustment based on API responses

### Backpressure Strategies
1. **Queue**: Hold requests until capacity available
2. **Reject**: Return error for exceeded limits
3. **Adaptive**: Slow down speculation and batch operations

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Prevents API quota exhaustion
- Fair resource allocation across users
- Graceful degradation under load
- Cost optimization through rate awareness

**Negative:**
- Adds latency during high load
- Complex configuration management
- Potential for queue buildup

## Implementation Details
```python
# Rate limit configuration example
rate_config = RateLimitConfig(
    global_max=1000,  # requests/second
    service_limits={
        "openai": {"requests": 500, "tokens": 150000},
        "anthropic": {"requests": 100, "tokens": 100000}
    },
    backpressure_strategy="adaptive"
)
```
