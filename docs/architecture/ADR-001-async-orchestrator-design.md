# ADR-001: Async Orchestrator Design Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The async-toolformer-orchestrator requires a high-performance, scalable architecture to handle parallel tool execution while maintaining rate limits and cancellation capabilities. The system must support GPT-4o's fast parallel tool calling with minimal latency.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered async orchestrator with the following components:

### Core Architecture
- **AsyncOrchestrator**: Main coordination engine
- **ToolDispatcher**: Manages parallel tool execution
- **RateLimitManager**: Handles service-specific rate limiting
- **SpeculationEngine**: Pre-fetches likely tool calls
- **ResultAggregator**: Streams and combines results

### Key Design Principles
1. **Async-First**: All operations use asyncio for maximum concurrency
2. **Rate Limit Aware**: Per-service and global rate limiting with backpressure
3. **Cancellation Safe**: Proper cleanup of cancelled operations
4. **Memory Efficient**: Streaming results and garbage collection
5. **Observable**: Comprehensive metrics and tracing

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- High performance with 6-7x speedup over sequential execution
- Robust rate limiting prevents API exhaustion
- Memory efficient for large-scale operations
- Comprehensive observability for debugging

**Negative:**
- Complex error handling across async boundaries
- Increased memory usage during peak concurrency
- Potential race conditions require careful synchronization

## Implementation Notes
- Use TaskGroup for structured concurrency (Python 3.11+)
- Implement circuit breakers for external API calls
- Use WeakRef for tool result caching to prevent memory leaks
- Leverage uvloop for performance optimization
