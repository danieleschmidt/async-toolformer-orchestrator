# ðŸ“‹ Deployment Note

## GitHub Workflow Restriction

The CI/CD GitHub Actions workflow file was generated during autonomous SDLC execution but cannot be committed due to GitHub App permission restrictions. The workflow file requires `workflows` permission which is not available in this context.

## Generated Workflow Content

The autonomous system generated a complete GitHub Actions workflow with:
- Automated testing on PR/push
- Security scanning
- Docker image building
- Multi-region deployment
- Staging and production environments

## Manual Setup Required

To enable the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` manually in your repository
2. Copy the workflow content from `production_deployment_guide.py` output
3. Configure the following repository secrets:
   - Container registry credentials
   - Kubernetes cluster access
   - Production environment variables

## Alternative Deployment

All other deployment artifacts are ready:
- âœ… Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/`
- âœ… Helm charts in `helm/`
- âœ… Monitoring configs in `monitoring/`
- âœ… Security policies in `security/`
- âœ… Complete deployment documentation

The system is fully production-ready except for the automated CI/CD pipeline setup.
